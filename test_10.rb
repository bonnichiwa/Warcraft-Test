# All units can attack and receive damage, so that logic should actually be on the Unit class, not the Peasant class
# This way, you don't have to add damage and attack methods on all types of units

# After making the tests pass, consider what modifications you can make to the Peasant and Footman classes to take advantage of this inheritence
